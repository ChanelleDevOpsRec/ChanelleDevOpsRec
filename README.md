- 👋 Hi, I’m @ChanelleDevOpsRec, I am a recruitment consultant that specialises in the recruitment of DevOps,Cloud,SRE and Infrastructure Engineers. I recently relocated from South Africa to join a company in the UK that focuses on the Netherlands market, We are recruiters with actual personalities!
- 👀 I’m interested in learning more about the DevOps market, When I'm not talking to Techy people you will find me playing PS games ( recently got into FIFA) 
- 🌱 I’m not currently learning anything but I have watched a few YouTube videos on the subject and looking into Udemy courses to understand the market better
- 💞️ I’m looking to meet with DevOps profesionals and to get to know them better and understand their career needs, I would like the opportunity to work with them on their careers and help them find companies that they would want to work for!
